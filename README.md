👋 Hi, I’m @BarTzukrel  
👨‍💻 I’m passionate about coding, especially with C# and object-oriented programming.  
🌱 Currently learning advanced C# concepts and working on small projects to sharpen my skills.  
💬 Always happy to talk about clean code, logic problems, and software development in general.  
📫 You can reach me by connecting here or checking out my latest projects.  
⚡ Fun fact: I strongly believe corn does **not** belong on pizza 😄
